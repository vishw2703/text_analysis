 Ever wondered how you get notified of the products or services you want or you have been looking for for a long time. Now how does this happen? Let me start with the simple and the most known fact- Marketing, 
 Marketing is a common term which everyone knows and is aware of. Marketing is the action of promoting products and services, including market research and  advertising. 
 Traditional Marketing was working fine for all these years. So why there was a need for online marketing? 
 The story begins from the internet era, The online presence of customers- 
 There are 4.72 billion people are on internet users in the world today and the number is increasing day by day. So if the companies want to create awareness about their products and services their is a huge audience present online. 
 There are a lot of benefits of online marketing like a large audience, benefits of targeting on the basis of demographics, location, age, gender, and many more. Because of this diversity, almost every type of company can use the Internet to reach any audience. All would find something of their liking. 
 Let’s take a look at what does online marketing involves. 
 Types of  Online marketing 
 Social Media Advertising 
 These days, almost everybody is on social media. The majority of people use Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other social media platforms to communicate with their friends and relatives. Some people have created companies solely based on their social media activity. 
 You can, however, promote your Knowledge Commerce products through social media. Whether or not you advertise on these sites. 
 The best social media networks for advertising- 
 Facebook advertising 
 Instagram advertising 
 Twitter advertising 
 Pinterest advertising 
 LinkedIn advertising 
 Snapchat advertising 
 Content Marketing 
 Content marketing is a strategic marketing strategy that focuses on producing and delivering useful, appropriate, and reliable content in order to attract and maintain a specific audience — and, eventually, to drive profitable consumer action. 
 In simple words, content marketing is a marketing strategy that producers and delivers relevant and reliable content to attract potential clients and to also retain existing clients. 
 PPC/Search advertising 
 About half of all website traffic originates from a search engine. People who use searches are often high-intent buyers. This indicates that they are searching for a particular item. They’re all set to buy the products and services. 
 The majority of online marketing is focused on pay-per-click (PPC). However, when you hear the word “PPC,” it refers to search ads. 
 Pay-per-click (PPC) advertising on search engines, social media sites, and other online venues can be extremely successful. 
 So the next time when you search for a product and services and you find similar ads on the internet this is a kind of internet marketing. 
 E-mail marketing 
 Email marketing is the highly successful digital marketing technique of sending emails to prospects and consumers. It allows communicating directly with the present, former, and potential customers. businesses will inform the audience about new products as they become aware of them. 
 Banner advertising 
 Banner ads are rectangular or square advertisements that appear above, in the sidebar, or below the content on websites. Usually, a banner ad leads to a sales or landing page. You will get great results by running banner ads on websites that attract members of the target audience. 
 Affiliate Marketing 
 An affiliate marketer, like a car salesperson, only gets paid when someone buys the stuff. You may not have to pay if there are no purchases. 
 Affiliates are free to sell your goods anywhere they choose (as long as the material follows the terms of service of the website). It’s a fantastic way to reach new markets. 
 Anyone can start their affiliate marketing career by registering on the different affiliate websites. 
 Influencer Marketing 
 Influencer marketing is a new trend for online marketing. They have a strong following, can inspire people to buy your goods, and are loved by their viewers. 
 The type of online marketing that will work best for the company will be determined by many factors, including the nature of your industry, the tastes and demographics of the target market, and budget. Market analysis will guide to the best strategy or combination of strategies for your offerings, and comprehensive performance metrics will show you which are the most effective. 
 Advantages of Online Marketing 
 
 Online advertising provides a large client base for a company’s services or products. All kinds of companies, from multinationals to small and medium enterprises, have access to millions of potential customers. The higher the number of users who visit your website, the more sales you can make. 
 One can advertise their company 24 hours a day, seven days a week, through online marketing campaigns. You just won’t have to think about employee pay or shop hours. Furthermore, time differences in different parts of the world will have no impact on your campaigns.  
 In today’s ads, social media is important. This is due to the fact that customers read comments and feedback left by other customers on the internet. Businesses can easily integrate social media tools into their advertising strategies and benefit from consumers who use social media extensively. 
 In an online marketing process, consumers can be demographically targeted even more effectively than in an offline process. Organizations will enhance their targeting over time, have a better understanding of their consumer base, and generate exclusive deals that are only shown to certain demographics when combined with the improved analytics. 
 
 Online marketing is a rapidly expanding industry that benefits companies in a variety of ways. The number of people who purchase goods and services online is on the rise. As a result, an increasing number of businesses around the world are turning to internet marketing to communicate with consumers and advertise their goods and services.
